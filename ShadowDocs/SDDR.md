# SDDR
sddr is an acronym for 'Shadow Engine Data Directory' and is used as a replacement for most commonly:
* `~/.config/Shadow` on UNIX
* OR
* `%AppData%\Shadow` on Windows

The acronym exists to unify all Shadow Engine data under a single directory across platforms, so whenever you see the acyonym 'sddr' in the Docs or the Code, you know where that folder exists.
